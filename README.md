# Conway's game of life

This is an implementation of the Conway's game of life. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)

Rules:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

These rules compare the behavior of the automaton to real life.
